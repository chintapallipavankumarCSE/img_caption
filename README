This project focuses on generating descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for language generation, the model can analyze an image and produce a coherent textual description. This application has diverse use cases, including aiding visually impaired individuals, enhancing search engine capabilities, and improving user experience in media applications.
